Promoboxes for Providence Seaside Theme
=======================================

I've been loving the [Seaside](http://providence-seaside.myshopify.com/) theme from Empyre and so have my clients. However the one feature missing was the promoboxes that are shown in the demo site. Empyre addresses the issue in their FAQs by suggesting a custom page with images. While this is a totally valid approach, I wanted one that allowed my client to update the boxes without calling on me. You can now do this by adding the code snippets here to the theme and thus turn on/off and edit the content/links via the theme settings.

The promoboxes:

The theme settings:

Some notes:

- This is my first time creating theme settings, so there maybe more efficient ways to do this
- You risk losing these changes when updating the theme. ALWAYS back your theme up before making big changes.
